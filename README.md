### Use Case: Vacant Parking Lot Detector

##### Scenario:
Approached by a Company for effective use and monitoring of Parking Lots. The task is to use a camera placed in the centre of the parking lot (giving a top view) to identify the number of vacant and occupied parking spots in real time. If all the parking spots are occupied and if any car enters, the system would alert the driver to park elsewhere.
